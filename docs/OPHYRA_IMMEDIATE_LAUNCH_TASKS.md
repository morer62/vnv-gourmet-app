# Ophyra Immediate Launch Tasks

## Purpose

This checklist defines the immediate work needed to launch Ophyra as a web commercial platform while continuing to operate VNV Events and Avomeal from User Level 1.

## Launch Position

Ophyra can launch in assisted soft-launch mode now.

That means:

* Web signup can receive new business customers.
* Level 2 business owners can complete billing, add cards, activate Ophyra Base and activate paid add-ons.
* Level 1 can monitor users, memberships, modules, payments and affiliates.
* VNV Events and Avomeal can continue being operated from User Level 1 as separate scoped operations.

Do not market Ophyra yet as a fully automatic enterprise SaaS with unattended subscription recovery, complex profile moderation or app-store mobile SaaS signup.

## Completed For Immediate Launch

1. Web signup remains the commercial signup path for new Ophyra businesses.
2. Mobile signup is guarded as final-client signup only.
3. Mobile signup no longer creates business owners or arbitrary user levels.
4. Mobile email/password, Google and Apple app signup bind clients to a business owner through `id_user_business`, `id_owner`, `business_id` or `owner_id`, with a documented Level 1 fallback for legacy branded apps.
5. Ophyra Base is free to start; paid add-ons write to `payments_all`.
6. Membership payments now support custom references and stable transaction IDs.
7. Autopay renewal now uses the audited membership payment path.
8. Autopay renewal now creates `payments_all` records.
9. Autopay renewal now triggers the affiliate commission path when a referral exists.
10. Level 1 manual membership payments now use the same audited membership payment path.
11. Level 1 saved-card membership charges now use the same audited membership payment path.
12. `payments_all.concept` now supports `OphyraAddon`.
13. Official Ophyra module rows are seeded and active.
14. Level 2 Billing & Modules can activate paid add-ons with a saved Stripe card.
15. Add-on activation logs payment in `payments_all`, activates `user_modules` and triggers affiliate commission when applicable.
16. Billing Automation foundation receives Stripe webhook events at `/api/stripe/webhook`.
17. Stripe events are logged in `stripe_billing_events` with idempotent processing.
18. Successful Stripe invoice/checkout events can renew Ophyra Base and paid add-ons when metadata is complete.
19. Failed Stripe invoices mark accounts/add-ons at risk without deleting data.
20. Level 1 can review webhook status from `/panel/billing-automation`.

## SQL Applied Locally

```text
db/ophyra_immediate_launch_required.sql
db/ophyra_billing_automation_required.sql
```

This SQL:

* adds `OphyraAddon` to `payments_all.concept`;
* inserts or updates all official Ophyra Base modules;
* inserts or updates all official paid add-ons.
* creates `stripe_billing_events`;
* adds billing idempotency fields to `payments_all`;
* adds billing/dunning status fields to `users` and `user_modules`.

Run these SQL files in production before enabling self-service add-on activation and Stripe webhook processing there.

## Still Not A Full Self-Service SaaS

These items remain future stabilization work:

* richer profile moderation statuses;
* production Stripe webhook QA with real subscription metadata;
* dunning, lockout and recovery emails;
* more polished affiliate public landing and affiliate self-service UX;
* full production payment processor QA with live Stripe mode;
* app-specific mobile signup owner configuration instead of fallback.

## Launch Recommendation

Launch Ophyra as:

```text
Soft launch / assisted onboarding
```

Messaging should be:

```text
Ophyra is open for early business onboarding. Billing, modules and operations are web-based. Add-ons can be activated from Billing & Modules, and Level 1 can assist or override when needed.
```
